## Procedure to upload to Sandbox Environment
+ connected using the sftp command sftp a99c57e22135@a99c57e22135.fb47f1e2.alx-cod.online
+ put in my password provided for my sandbox
+ typed ls to check where I was and lls to check where the file was located on my local machine
+ Used the put command and *.png to select all the 3 screen shots
+ also used -r Desktop to push the same images to the sandbox enviroment(will use remote from now)
+ had two copies on the remote


## Procedure to move them to the specified folder ie alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win

+ Used rename /root/Desktop /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/ to move the files to the specified folder
+ Note that when using sftp some commands wont work like they would on your local so mv was not working and had to use rename because it does the same this as mv
